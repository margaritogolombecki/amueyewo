I played around with a de0 nano for a bit a couple years back, i'm a software dev and have CS background. I have a board i purchased for "litecoin mining" a while back, never really used it, and it came with very few tools. Here i is : https://vimeo.com/81143920 It's the "Scryptor 8x" board, it's composed of 8 altera chips, most likely Cyclone IV. It's got an tethernet port, usb, and some ram on the board. As well as some microcontrollers (probably for ethernet) How do i get started explorin. Компания ГАММА осуществляет поставку ПЛИС Altera (Stratix, Cyclone, MAX, FPGA, CPLD), Lattice, оптроны. Our tutorials are intended for self-study by students. The tutorials cover our FPGA boards, software tools, including the Quartus® CAD system, the Nios® II and ARM processors, and other topics. 1. Does anyone knows whether Cyclone V support MTU9000? By using the Linux stmmac driver, I only managed to set maximum MTU8144. 2. Anyone can suggest a 10Gbit/s dedicated EMAC IC to be interfaced with Altera Cyclone V? It must be well supported in u-boot and Linux Find and share solutions with Intel users across the world This is a community forum where members can ask and answer questions about Intel products. I have a Terasic card (Cyclone IV GX) with Ethernet and PCIe interfaces. I want to use the PCIe interface to send tasks from the host machine (Windows OS) to the card to be processed. What's the general process for doing this painlessly? I don't really want to be writing my own device driver for the card, I just want some sort of C-like interface for communicating 当キットは、アルティマが開発した Cyclone ® V SoC のスターターキットです。 Cyclone V SoC を評価するために必要な機能を搭載していますので、誰でも簡単に Cyclone V SoC を評価して頂く事が可能です。. Hello, I’ve been trying to decide on a FPGA development board, and have only been able to find posts and Reddit threads from 4-5 years ago. So I wanted to start a new thread and ask about the best “mid-range” FGPA development board in 2018. (Price range 0-0.) I started with this Quora answer about FPGA boards, from 2013 (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-affordable-FPGA-dev-kit-for-a-starter/answer/Gregory-James?ch=10ampshare=7e58beccampsrid=37TL). The Altera DE1 sounded good. Hi, I've been implementing some designs with the Xilinx ZYNQ. I need to do fast measurements of several ADC's which happen concurrently through several SPI controllers running in the FPGA. I then upload the data to the DDR3 connected to the PS part of the Zynq to send then with LWIP over ethernet. The transfer of the data goes through a DMA Ip block which is run in Scatter Gather mode. I might be using the different subsystems wrong as I feel that the ARM core prohibits the DMA transfer. 
Hi everyone ! First of all, I’m French, and a beginner in FPGA programming, so please don’t mind my lack of vocabulary :) Alright, brief description of what I’m trying to achieve : - I’m using a SoC Cyclone V board from Terasic, the de0-nano-SoC board, based on a Cyclone V - acquisition of analog signals with the embedded ADC (speed is critical here) - store the readings in a rotating buffer (speed also critical) - when the user triggers the system (with a switch for instance) The link was dead. Of that there was no doubt. Yet the fat man who sat at his laptop cursing kept clicking on it anyway. He had been promised amusing jpegs of penguins and the Internet needed to make good on it. As he clicked and hit refresh, he scarcely noticed wind blowing without. It was a strange wind. A wind that chilled the bones more than the snow upon the ground. An ill wind that blew through the cracks and crevices in the house and carried lightly upon the stairs on ethereal feet. Poor internet connections, lag, or just lag spikes, are one of the most common complains in POE. People claim they have the best connections they can achieve in their area, yeah they some how can't manage to maintain a stable connection while playing POE. There are 3 major causes for this, that most of the time are the cause of this issue. - Poor PC quality with outdated graphics cards (even a couple years is enough to become outdated) or low RAM. A poor pc will have trouble just handling Hello! The time has come for me to pick what my next summer project will be, and I have decided I am going to get down into the nitty gritty parts of FPGAs. I took a digital systems class this semester, and we used a VHDL with Quartus and an Altera development board; however, some of their boards are pretty pricey and I'm on a student budget (not looking to spend much more than 0). Right now, I've got my eyes on this cyclone IV board (http://www.waveshare.com/product/fpga-tools/altera/core/c. Anyone have any idea why the Ethernet ports on my MacPro5,1 (running 10.11.6) go "Inactive" when my APC BackUPS XS1500 UPS kicks in due to a power failure? I'm using apcupsd to manage the UPS, and everything else stays up during power failures, including my ATTO FastFrame 10gigE card, which is installed in an external Cyclone PCIe chassis. So I'm flummoxed as to why the built-in GigE ports in the Mac itself go down when the power goes out? This is a problem for me, because I have an apcupsd. I am helping a professor develop tutorials for a digital circuits class that uses the Altera Cyclone V FPGA on a DE1-SoC board. They have a final project which involves being able to design their own project with the approval of the professor. We wish to create tutorials and provide drivers for various board components such as audio, VGA, ethernet, USB mouse, and USB keyboard. We have completed audio and VGA so far, but we are having trouble with the USB mouse and keyboard. I cannot I'm having trouble connecting my PS3 to the school's wifi. I already registered it using the MAC address on Cyclone, but it still can't connect to the internet. I'm using an ethernet cable and it always fails to connect to the internet when I test the connection. Thanks in advance. Hello Linux Admins! I have installed a new network card in a server, and the system is not automatically detecting it. I searched google, and came upon this linux from scratch article ( which comes close to answering my question. However, the issue I have is that per the example, the bus position is determined by the directory in which the device is found. In the example, the directory is /sys/devices/pci000. Hey guys, I'm in the market for a FPGA, I'm a hobbyist but I have big plans. So I've been looking at development boards like crazy of the last couple days, but now I'm having trouble picking if I want Xilinx of Altera. Based on the prices I'm leaning towards Xilinx because I feel the Spartan-6 is close to the Cyclone IV in feature, but is about half the price for similar features. Also it seems like there are more Xilinx tested IP cores out there than there are Altera, which I hope means. 
I just got a nice deal on a Core i7, so I'm selling my Core i5-2500K. It was ran at 4.5GHz on 1.38V if I remember right, had it mostly stable at 4.8GHz but was waiting to put a real nice cooler on it before I tried for all-night Prime95s at that frequency or made a run at 5GHz. I have the original box, cooler (optional if you want it), and invoice from Newegg, only a month or so old. I don't know how Intel does warranties, but I'm happy to assist in any warranty issue should </p>
