TL;DR: Need something like Passion Planner minus the calendar part in form of an app So, for a bit of context, this is where I am coming from: After several years of basically just living, having ups and downs but never really developing or progressing, I did a cut in my life about two years ago. I started taking action and began to organize and improve my day-to-day rythm. I got more serious about tracking my expenses. I started looking for a own apartment, and early last year ended

I recently fell down the paper planner hole and have been looking for a good guided, goal based planner. I'm still using a lot of digital stuff (Google calendar, 2do for tasks) so I don't necessarily need a lot of calendar space in it, though a week view is probably helpful for planning purposes. Came across these two planners that look intriguing: https://www.amazon.com/GOALDRVN-Notebook-Hardcover-Productivity-Self-Adhesive/dp/B077Y55C91 https://www.amazon.com/InnerGuide-Planner-Monthly-Org. ### Hello /r/ethtrader!

About myself: My name's Nate R., I live in North Carolina and I've been a regular guy with regular jobs for 6 cake days or so. Board game strategy has always been a passion of mine, and I'm finally doing something professionally about it, by which I mean I've, insanely enough, taken a recent layoff from my job as an energy planner as an opportunity to work 10+ hours per day on Nuclear Tactics. I grew up playing board games such as Risk, Monopoly, Stratego, Chess, and Checkers with my family. Anybody as in love with the Passion Planner as I am?! I am very serious about my planners and was looking for one that was, of course, organized, but I also wanted something that included goal-setting/motivational methods. Discovered the passion planner has free PDF versions of the planner online, so I decided to try them and now I know I am life long customer. The planner includes 2 major "passion maps" that help with goal-setting at the beginning of the year and in the middle of the year. For the past year I've been designing a planner. I really want this planner to be a tool to help people reach their goals and chase their passions regardless of their financial ability. Knowing from experience how it feels like to be a full time college student I know how tight money can get especially around the holidays. With that being said I have released an undated version of the my planners weekly layout for anyone to download and print for free. It has: a section to write. I've been reading a lot of threads in /r/truegaming about why RPGs are less compelling than they used to be, etc.It got me thinking. Procedural generation does allow for a lot of emergent storytelling. I see my friends go crazy when they play Binding of Isaac:Rebirth  However, it is still almost unused in RPGs ( Shadows of Mordor took a step in the right direction, I think). Why not create an abstract library that would work just as well for non-violent games? Or "violence-optional" games. I want to print my PDF version of the passion planner but can't figure out how to make it double sided AND read like a book to put in a binder. Thank you in advance. 
Has anyone ever tried combining Passion Planner ( ) and Microsoft OneNote? So, I've really been on a mission to try to get myself more organized. I've recently started making the transition to OneNote. I know I'm not using it to its full potential, but I have every intention of getting there. On top of that, I really want prioritize my professional and personal goals  which is where Passion Planner came in. I downloaded the PDF for it, and while it looks kinda. </p>
