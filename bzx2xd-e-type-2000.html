I think it was some type of dating show on VH1 or another quasi-music channel. There was either a guy competing against his ex or it had some kind of relationship aspect to the show. I remember watching it sometime around 1999 or 2000. The loser of the show would get shamed in an issue of Enterntainment Weekly. I don't remember what the winner got. Does anyone remember the name of the show and if there's episodes or clips from it? It wasn't Singled Out, but I do remember some pretty young thing.

So I've done a mess of work to get my echo running again to no avail. I've replaced the piston rings and have fantastic compression, replaced head gasket, rebuilt and throughly cleaned the carb with new needle valve, valve spring, gaskets and diaphragms, replaced fuel lines and filter, new spark plug and gapped the ignition coil perfectly within spec. I've also cleaned the spark arrestor and replaced all old fuel with new tru-fuel ethanol free pre-mixed fuel. I've tried starting so many times. –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏ E-Type –Ω–∞ DriveMusic. –¢—Ä–µ–∫–∏ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–≤–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ  06.02. 14. 03:38. –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å ¬∑ Campione 2000 (Uefa Euro 2000) E-Type. 10.06.16. 03:33.

Sooooo I went and got myself a Reikenor, and have the Spirit Hosts and Hexwraiths from Malignant. I've started dabbling around in Battlescribe but have no clue of what a balanced list would look like, so I just picked as I went, and ended up with what follows.

The title pretty much says it all. I wanted to have a low-model count second army after I finish my KO, and had some leftover Prosecutors and a Knight Venator after deciding not to use one of their warscroll battalions. Right now, I have those and the Evocators actually in my possession. The Sequitor division is wonky because, frankly, I just don‚Äôt want to buy more models than I have to. üòÇ I also wanted to have a pretty large centerpiece model, since my largest model in my KO army is my frigate. Twenty points over. warscroll battalions don‚Äôt seem worth it to me.

I'm fairly new at the game so I wanted some feedback on this list I came up with. The general Idea was to have the skinks be the meat shields while I shoot them up and have the terradon riders and cold one riders flank while I summon more big monster duders or infantry as needed ++ Pitched Battle 2,000 (Order - Seraphon) 1990pts ++ + Battalion + Battalion: Dracothian's Tail 1300pts  Bastiladon: Solar Engine  Battalion: Firela. My current Sylvaneth list has no batallions in it and seems to underperform as compared to the people I play with since I have no big army-wide abilities (no reroll saves/attacks/wounds even conditionally). My goal is to keep them busy with dryads and heavy hitting trees/wizards while the Tree Revenants pressure objectives and generally keep them spread out. Is the list good, and ive just been dealing with bad dice rolls in my first few games, or is there something systemically wrong?. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do with the last 100 points. Happy to cut stuff too, most of this is still in shrink so I have flexibility. ++ Pitched Battle 2,000 (Destruction - Gloomspite Gitz) 1900pts ++ + Leader + Loonboss on Mangler Squigs 300pts Skragrott, the Loonking 220pts + Battleline + Squig Herd 140pts : 2x 5 Squigs Squig Herd 140pts.

After looking over a few models I realized adding the Lord Celestant on Stardrake to my existing list and it would bring me right to 2000.
